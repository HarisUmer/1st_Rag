Biodiverse regions that require protection on the grounds that they host a significant number of endangered species are called hot spots.', '(Read E.O. Wilson’s Britannica essay on mass extinction.)', 'Previously, any species of plant or animal that was threatened with extinction could be called an endangered species. The need for separate definitions of “endangered” and “threatened” species resulted in the development of various categorization systems, each containing definitions and criteria by which a species can be classified according to its risk of extinction. As a rule, a range of criteria must be analyzed before a species can be placed in one category or another.', 'Often such categorization systems are linked directly to national legislation, such as the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) or the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA). In addition, regional agreements, such as the European Union’s Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC), and international conservation agreements, such as the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), are connected to species-assessment systems. One of the most-recognized independent international systems of species assessment is the Red List of Threatened Species, created by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).', 'Human beings and endangered species', 'Roughly 99 percent of threatened species are at risk because of human activities alone. By the early 21st century it could be said that human beings (Homo sapiens) are the greatest threat to biodiversity and are the major drivers of biodiversity loss. The principal threats to species in the wild are:', 'Habitat loss and habitat degradation', 'The spread of introduced species (that is, non-native species that negatively affect the ecosystems they become part of)', 'The growing influence of global warming and chemical pollution', 'Unsustainable hunting', 'Disease', '', \"Edith's checkerspot\", \"Edith's checkerspot (Euphydryas editha), native to North America. Two subspecies are listed as endangered species.(more)\", '', 'alula', 'Alula (Brighamia insignis), a rare and critically endangered plant native to Hawaii.(more)', 'Although some of these hazards occur naturally, most are caused by human beings and their economic and cultural activities. The most pervasive of these threats is habitat loss and degradation—that is, the large-scale conversion of land in previously undisturbed areas driven by the growing demand for commercial agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development. Because the rates of loss are highest in some of the most biologically diverse regions on Earth, a perpetual battle is waged to manage destructive activities there while limiting the impact that such restrictions may have on the well-being of local communities. The relative importance of each threat differs within and among taxa. So far, incidental mortality from ecological disturbance, temporary or limited human disturbance, and persecution have caused limited reductions in the total number of species; however, these phenomena can be serious for some susceptible groups. In addition, global warming has emerged as a widespread threat, and much research is being conducted to identify its potential effects on specific species, populations, and ecosystems.', '', 'Special 67% offer for students! Finish the semester strong with Britannica.', 'Learn More', '', 'mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei)', 'Adult male mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Virunga National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo.(more)', 'Conflicts between human activities and conservation are at the root of many of these phenomena. Such controversies are often highly politicized and widely publicized in the global press and through social media. For example, habitat loss and species loss have resulted from the unregulated exploitation of coltan (the rare ore for tantalum used in consumer electronics products such as mobile phones and computers) in Kahuzi-Beiga National Park, one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s premier forest parks. The park is also home to much of the population of the threatened Eastern Lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri). Mining has increased gorilla mortality by reducing the animal’s food resources and leading many people displaced by the mining to kill gorillas for their meat. In addition, the mountain gorilla (G. beringei beringei), a close relative of the Eastern Lowland gorilla, is also at risk of extinction. However, authorities cite poaching, disease, and crossfire between warring political groups in the vicinity of Virunga National Park as the primary sources of its population decline.', '', 'axolotl', 'Albino axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum).', 'Another example of a widely publicized wildlife controversy involves the relatively recent declines in amphibian populations. Known to be important global indicators of environmental health, amphibians have experienced some of the most serious population declines to date of all groups that have been assessed globally through the IUCN Red List process (see below).

It is important to note that the IUCN cites very specific criteria for each of these categories, and the descriptions given below have been condensed to highlight two or three of the category’s most salient points. In addition, three of the categories (CR, EN, and VU) are contained within the broader notion of “threatened.” The list recognizes several categories of species status:', 'Extinct (EX), species in which the last individual has died or where systematic and time-appropriate surveys have been unable to log even a single individual', 'Extinct in the Wild (EW), species whose members survive only in captivity or as artificially supported populations far outside their historical geographic range', 'Critically Endangered (CR), species that possess an extremely high risk of extinction as a result of rapid population declines of 80 to more than 90 percent over the previous 10 years (or three generations), a current population size of fewer than 50 individuals, or other factors (such as severely fragmented populations, long generation times, or isolated habitats)', 'Endangered (EN), species that possess a very high risk of extinction as a result of rapid population declines of 50 to more than 70 percent over the previous 10 years (or three generations), a current population size of fewer than 250 individuals, or other factors', 'Vulnerable (VU), species that possess a very high risk of extinction as a result of rapid population declines of 30 to more than 50 percent over the previous 10 years (or three generations), a current population size of fewer than 1,000 individuals, or other factors', 'Near Threatened (NT), species that are close to becoming threatened or may meet the criteria for threatened status in the near future', 'Least Concern (LC), a category containing species that are pervasive and abundant after careful assessment', 'Data Deficient (DD), a condition applied to species in which the amount of available data related to its risk of extinction is lacking in some way.

Likewise, another species undergoing a 50 percent decline over the same period would be classified as endangered, and one experiencing a 30 percent reduction over the same time frame would be considered vulnerable. It is important to understand, however, that a species cannot be classified by using one criterion alone; it is essential for the scientist doing the assessment to consider all five criteria to determine the status. Each year, thousands of scientists around the world assess or reassess species according to these criteria, and the IUCN Red List is subsequently updated with these new data once the assessments have been checked for accuracy to help provide a continual spotlight on the status of the world’s species.', 'The IUCN Red List brings into focus the ongoing decline of Earth’s biodiversity and the influence humans have on life on the planet.

Deforestation represents one of the largest issues in global land use. Estimates of deforestation traditionally are based on the area of forest cleared for human use, including removal of the trees for wood products and for croplands and grazing lands. In the practice of clear-cutting, all the trees are removed from the land, which completely destroys the forest. In some cases, however, even partial logging and accidental fires thin out the trees enough to change the forest structure dramatically.', 'History', 'Conversion of forests to land used for other purposes has a long history. Earth’s croplands, which cover about 49 million square km (18.9 million square miles), are mostly deforested land. Most present-day croplands receive enough rain and are warm enough to have once supported forests of one kind or another. Only about 1 million square km (390,000 square miles) of cropland are in areas that would have been cool boreal forests, as in Scandinavia and northern Canada. Much of the remainder was once moist subtropical or tropical forest or, in eastern North America, western Europe, and eastern China, temperate forest.', 'Brazil', 'The coastal forest of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, badly fragmented as portions were cleared for cattle grazing.(more)', 'The extent to which forests have become Earth’s grazing lands is much more difficult to assess.

At least 2 million square km (772,204 square miles) of such forests have been cleared for grazing lands. Less certain are the humid tropical forests and some drier tropical woodlands that have been cleared for grazing. These often support only very low numbers of domestic grazing animals, but they may still be considered grazing lands by national authorities. Almost half the world is made up of “drylands”—areas too dry to support large numbers of trees—and most are considered grazing lands. There, goats, sheep, and cattle may harm what few trees are able to grow.', 'Although most of the areas cleared for crops and grazing represent permanent and continuing deforestation, deforestation can be transient. About half of eastern North America lay deforested in the 1870s, almost all of it having been deforested at least once since European colonization in the early 1600s.

They range from rainforests that are hot and wet year-round to forests that are merely humid and moist, to those in which trees in varying proportions lose their leaves in the dry season, and to dry open woodlands.

In addition, each year fires burn an area about half as large as the areas that are cleared. Even when the forest is not entirely cleared, what remains is often a patchwork of forests and fields or, in the event of more intensive deforestation, “islands” of forest surrounded by a “sea” of deforested areas.', 'The commercial palm oil industry rapidly expanded in the late 20th century and led to the deforestation of significant swaths of Indonesia and Malaysia as well as large areas in Africa.

Some of this replanting is done to replenish logging areas for future exploitation, and some replanting is done as a form of ecological restoration, with the reforested areas made into protected land. Additionally, significant areas are planted as monotypic plantations for lumber or paper production. These are often plantations of eucalyptus or fast-growing pines—and almost always of species that are not native to the places where they are planted.

Moist tropical forests such as the Amazon have the greatest concentrations of animal and plant species of any terrestrial ecosystem; perhaps two-thirds of Earth’s species live only in these forests. As deforestation proceeds, it has the potential to cause the extinction of increasing numbers of these species.', 'On a more local scale, the effects of forest clearing, selective logging, and fires interact. Selective logging increases the flammability of the forest because it converts a closed, wetter forest into a more open, drier one. This leaves the forest vulnerable to the accidental movement of fires from cleared adjacent agricultural lands and to the killing effects of natural droughts. As wildfires, logging, and droughts continue, the forest can become progressively more open until all the trees are lost. Additionally, the burning of tropical forests is generally a seasonal phenomenon and can severely impact air quality. Record-breaking levels of air pollution have occurred in Southeast Asia as the result of burning for oil palm plantations.', 'In the tropics, much of the deforested land exists in the form of steep mountain hillsides. The combination of steep slopes, high rainfall, and the lack of tree roots to bind the soil can lead to disastrous landslides that destroy fields, homes, and human lives. With the significant exception of the forests destroyed for the oil palm industry, many of the humid forests that have been cleared are soon abandoned as croplands or only used for low-density grazing because the soils are extremely poor in nutrients. (To clear forests, the vegetation that contains most of the nutrients is often burned, and the nutrients literally “go up in smoke” or are washed away in the next rain.)', 'Although forests may regrow after being cleared and then abandoned, this is not always the case, especially if the remaining forests are highly fragmented. Such habitat fragmentation isolates populations of plant and animal species from each other, making it difficult to reproduce without genetic bottlenecks, and the fragments may be too small to support large or territorial animals. Furthermore, deforested lands that are planted with commercially important trees lack biodiversity and do not serve as habitats for native plants and animals, many of which are endangered species.', 'Overharvesting, exploiting a natural resource until its supply is so diminished that its exploitation is no longer sustainable. Resources that can be overharvested include plants, terrestrial animals, fish and marine invertebrates, and renewable natural elements, such as forests.

Overharvesting can disrupt the structure of the food chain, causing a trophic cascade. That phenomenon occurs when the natural order of predators and prey in an ecosystem is upended, and it can have far-reaching consequences. For example, the population of sea otters in the Aleutian Islands was nearly hunted to extinction for their pelts in the early 1900s. Then scientists realized that the sea otters had been keeping the sea urchin population in check, which allowed kelp to flourish in the area. Healthy kelp forests serve as habitat for fish and other marine organisms and absorb carbon dioxide as well, helping to stop ocean acidification and mitigate effects of global warming. In places where otter numbers declined, kelp abundance also declined because the unchecked population of sea urchins consumed more and more kelp.', 'African elephant', 'African elephant (Loxodonta africana).', 'Overharvesting also tends to remove the oldest and largest members of a population. For example, overfishing often leaves many juvenile fish, which are more susceptible to predation than larger, adult fish, and it removes sexually mature fish, which reduces reproduction rates and hence makes the population even less likely to recover. About 20 million tropical fish and 12 million corals—many of them large and mature specimens—are harvested annually for the aquarium trade, depleting natural populations in some parts of the world. In Africa ivory poachers frequently slaughter the oldest elephants in a herd, dramatically altering the animals’ small, matriarchal family groups.', '', 'terrestrial hot spots of biodiversity', 'Overharvesting of species from biodiversity hot spots, such as the forests of Southeast Asia and South America, puts pressure on endangered species such as orangutans and can generate critical habitat loss. Biodiversity, the presence of a variety of living things in a place, is an important predictor of the health of an ecosystem. Compared with areas that lack biodiversity, ecosystems that have a variety of species are more likely to be able to cope with pests and diseases, and diverse landscapes are more resistant to natural disasters like wildfires and floods. In addition, some sections of the Amazon basin and other terrestrial and marine hot spots are still unexplored and likely hold organisms unknown to science and medicine. For example, the tree Cinchona officinalis, used for centuries by Indigenous people in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador to suppress shivering, contains the alkaloid compound quinine, which was developed into the first chemotherapeutic antimalarial drug in the 1800s (see also Malaria through history).

About 1900, as technology advanced, more and more fishing operations adopted trawlers for bottom trawling, in which large nets are dragged over the ocean floor. In addition to catching hundreds of thousands of pounds of cod at a time, these nets captured nontarget species as bycatch and destroyed habitats. The pressure from foreign fisheries in the area also increased about this time. By 1970 the annual cod catch was being reported as three times too high to be sustainable, but mismanagement allowed heavy fishing to continue. By 1992 the cod population had crashed, and the Canadian government instituted a moratorium on cod fishing. The cod population has not recovered, and hence this fish is commercially extinct in the northwest Atlantic.', '', 'Special 67% offer for students!

In 2022 Alaska’s state government canceled the harvesting season for snow crab (genus Chionoecetes) in the Bering Sea for the first time in history following a major decline in snow crab populations, largely attributed to warming ocean temperatures coupled with the killing of crabs as bycatch by trawlers. The projected loss to Alaska’s fisheries was $500 million, and many crabbing operations were expected to be bankrupted.', 'Controlling overharvesting frequently requires government intervention in industries and areas of concern, though NGOs and private-sector efforts—including those of individual firms with a vested interest in sustainability—have also had some success. Given that poaching is a major existential threat to numerous wild organisms worldwide, laws that prevent poaching and the indiscriminate trade in wildlife must be improved and enforced. Limiting the types of harvesting activities allowed in an area can also help reduce the impact of overharvesting—for example, banning trawling in snow crab breeding grounds or allowing hunting only during certain seasons and requiring the purchase of permits to take animals. Other solutions include the imposition of strict catch limits in fishing zones to ensure that fish populations can recover and the setting of bag limits for the hunting of terrestrial animals. The introduction of exclusive economic zones in 1976 has also helped retain resources for local communities.

They also can tolerate extreme temperatures in a desiccated state.', 'Biological crusts carry out myriad ecological roles. They are important sources of fixed carbon in sparsely vegetated areas. Cyanobacteria and cyanolichens in the crusts convert atmospheric nitrogen into organic compounds that leak into surrounding soil, which is especially important in desert ecosystems where low soil nitrogen levels often limit plant growth. Crusts with roughened surfaces slow rainwater runoff and increase water infiltration into the soil. After sporadic rainfall, crust organisms and their mucilage absorb up to 10 times their volume in water and later release the water slowly into the soil.', 'When dry, cyanobacterial filaments, mosses, and lichens are brittle and crush easily.

About half of the world’s population — that’s more than 4 billion people — will have an opportunity to go to the polls in 2024.', 'But the sad reality is that even people who can participate in democracy often don’t.

Franky, they go hand in hand — especially amid a growing love affair between autocrats and sexists.', 'Autocrats fear women. And the women’s movement needs more allies. So if we can align the women’s movement with the movement for democracy, we can get a lot done — and we can potentially build a more peaceful world, too. As the UN Deputy Secretary-General [Amina Mohammed] said at our recent We the Peoples awards dinner, “Men like to win wars; women like to end wars.” I don’t want to paint with too broad a brush, but why don’t we finally give women their rightful spot at the table and a real shot at negotiating and building peace? Isn’t it time to take seriously the imperative to have women’s full participation in peace and security matters?

But institutional reform is not a silver bullet, and we need to be more creative about how we mobilize resources with the tools available to us now. Look at what’s happening at the International Maritime Organization.', 'In what I consider a watershed moment, this past July the IMO raised its ambition and adopted a new greenhouse gas strategy with a goal of reducing emissions to net zero “by or around” 2050. This was significant because the sector already accounts for 3% of global emissions and that share will grow substantially if we don’t do something about it.', 'Now, the IMO will develop the regulations necessary for achieving this goal. This will include a fuel standard, and, notably, an “emission pricing mechanism” that could be an important tool in mobilizing the finance needed to support a just and equitable transition to a clean, sustainable global shipping sector.', 'These and many other finance-related questions will be debated next year against the backdrop of a COP where climate finance will be at the forefront of the agenda.

By the end of this century, 80% of the global population will live across Africa and Asia. So when we think about achieving the SDGs and securing a better world, we have to be thinking about the places that will be home to the majority of future generations. Do young people in those countries have access to a quality education? Are they able to enjoy good health? Are there enough jobs? You can clearly see the imperative of the SDGs in the lives of young people living in those countries. And we cannot fail them. We can’t leave 80% of the world behind, because what kind of world would that be?', 'Pete: There were some positive developments at COP 28 in terms of addressing the needs of many of the most climate-vulnerable communities. Most notably, a brand new climate fund was established that is dedicated to addressing loss and damage caused by increasingly devastating climate-related impacts. The Loss and Damage Fund garnered some $700 million in pledges, and while this may pale in comparison to the full economic and financial impacts of climate damage, it is still vitally needed.

But the truth is that for most of the big issues countries face, the only solutions are international. Solutions are very seldom found within national borders. And that creates continual demand for international cooperation.', 'Luisa: I often ask people, what’s the alternative? If not the UN, then where are we going to go to get global support and agreement for gender equality? There isn’t an alternative. Because despite their flaws, the UN and the spaces around it are invaluable. They foster conversations around solving the world’s biggest problems. Even when countries don’t agree, it’s the best platform to find collective solutions.', 'David: Moving forward, it’s essential that the UN keeps the promises it’s already made. The UN must be a platform to continue marshaling the finance, strategies, solutions, and partnerships that are needed to deliver on all 17 SDGs and the promises made under the Paris Agreement.

Instead of planning economic decisions through centralized political methods, as with socialism or feudalism, economic planning under capitalism occurs via decentralized, competitive, and voluntary decisions.', 'Capitalism is essentially an economic system in which the means of production—factories, tools, machines, raw materials, etc—are organized by one or more business owners, also known as capitalists. Capitalists then hire workers to operate the means of production in return for wages. Workers have no claim on the means of production or on the profits generated from their labor; these belong to the capitalists.1', '', \"As such, private property rights are fundamental to capitalism. Most modern concepts of private property stem from John Locke's theory of homesteading, in which human beings claim ownership by mixing their labor with unclaimed resources. Once owned, the only legitimate means of transferring property are through voluntary exchange, gifts, inheritance, or the re-homesteading of abandoned property.2\", 'Private property promotes efficiency by giving the owner of resources an incentive to maximize the value of their property. The more valuable a resource is, the more trading power it provides the owner. In a capitalist system, the person who owns the property is entitled to any value associated with that property.', '', 'Why Private Property Rights Matter for Capitalism', 'For individuals or businesses to deploy their capital goods confidently, a system must exist that protects their legal right to own or transfer private property. A capitalist society relies on the use of contracts, fair dealing, and tort law to facilitate and enforce these private property rights.', \"When property isn't privately owned but rather is shared by the public, a problem known as the tragedy of the commons can emerge. With a common pool resource—which all people can use and none can limit access to—all individuals have an incentive to extract as much use-value as they can and no incentive to conserve or reinvest in the resource. Privatizing the resource is one possible solution to this problem, along with various voluntary or involuntary collective action approaches.3\", 'Under capitalist production, the business owners retain ownership of the goods being produced.

Up until the 12th century, a very small percentage of the population of Europe lived in towns. Skilled workers lived in the city but received their keep from feudal lords rather than a real wage, and most workers were serfs for landed nobles. However, by the late Middle Ages, rising urbanism, with cities as centers of industry and trade, became more and more economically important.', \"Under feudalism, society was segmented into social classes based on birth or family lineage. Lords (nobility) were the landowners, while serfs (peasants and laborers) didn't own land but were under the employ of the landed nobility.\", '', 'The advent of industrialization revolutionized the trades and encouraged more people to move into towns where they could earn more money working in a factory than existing at a subsistence level in exchange for labor.', 'Mercantilism', \"Mercantilism gradually replaced the feudal economic system in Western Europe and became the primary economic system of commerce during the 16th to 18th centuries.

Initially, each town had vastly different products and services that were slowly homogenized over time by demand.6\", '', 'After the homogenization of goods, trade was carried out in broader and broader circles: town to town, county to county, province to province, and, finally, nation to nation. When too many nations were offering similar goods for trade, the trade took on a competitive edge that was sharpened by strong feelings of nationalism on a continent that was constantly embroiled in wars.', \"Colonialism flourished alongside mercantilism, but the nations seeding the world with settlements weren't trying to increase trade. Most colonies were set up with an economic system that smacked of feudalism, with their raw goods going back to the motherland and, in the case of the British colonies in North America, being forced to repurchase the finished product with a pseudo-currency that prevented them from trading with other nations.\", '', 'It was economist Adam Smith who noticed that mercantilism was a regressive system that was creating trade imbalances between nations and keeping them from advancing. His ideas for a free market opened the world to capitalism.7', '', 'The Growth of Industry', \"Adam Smith's ideas were well-timed, as the Industrial Revolution was starting to cause tremors that would soon shake the Western world. The (often-literal) gold mine of colonialism had brought new wealth and new demand for the products of domestic industries, which drove the expansion and mechanization of production.\", 'As technology leaped ahead and factories no longer had to be built near waterways or windmills to function, industrialists began building in the cities where there were now thousands of people to supply labor.', '', 'Capitalism involved reorganizing society into social classes based not on ownership of land, but ownership of capital (in other words, businesses). Capitalists were able to earn profits from the surplus labor of the working class, who earned only wages.

The primary concern of the socialist model is the redistribution of wealth and resources from the rich to the poor, out of fairness, and to ensure equality in opportunity and equality of outcome. Equality is valued above high achievement, and the collective good is viewed above the opportunity for individuals to advance.', '', 'Efficiency', 'The capitalist argument is that the profit incentive drives corporations to develop innovative new products desired by the consumer and in demand in the marketplace. It is argued that the state ownership of the means of production leads to inefficiency because, without the motivation to earn more money, management, workers, and developers are less likely to put forth the extra effort to push new ideas or products.', '', 'Employment', \"In a capitalist economy, the state doesn't directly employ the workforce.

Its core principles are accumulation, ownership, and profiting from capital. In its purest form, capitalism works best when these private owners have assurances that the wealth they generate will be kept in their own pocket, which is often a controversial proposition.', '', 'Capitalism is the dominant world economic system, although it often isn’t pure in form.

were prevalent', '', 'Capitalism grew out of European feudalism', ' Up until the 12th century, a very small percentage of the population of Europe lived in towns', ' Skilled workers lived in the city but received their keep from feudal lords rather than a real wage, and most workers were serfs for landed nobles', ' However, by the late Middle Ages, rising urbanism, with cities as centers of industry and trade, became more and more economically important', '', 'Under feudalism, society was segmented into social classes based on birth or family lineage', \" Lords (nobility) were the landowners, while serfs (peasants and laborers) didn't own land but were under the employ of the landed nobility\", '', 'The advent of industrialization revolutionized the trades and encouraged more people to move into towns where they could earn more money working in a factory than existing at a subsistence level in exchange for labor', '', 'Mercantilism gradually replaced the feudal economic system in Western Europe and became the primary economic system of commerce during the 16th to 18th centuries', \" Mercantilism started as trade between towns, but it wasn't necessarily competitive trade\", ' Initially, each town had vastly different products and services that were slowly homogenized over time by demand', 'After the homogenization of goods, trade was carried out in broader and broader circles: town to town, county to county, province to province, and, finally, nation to nation', ' When too many nations were offering similar goods for trade, the trade took on a competitive edge that was sharpened by strong feelings of nationalism on a continent that was constantly embroiled in wars', '', \"Colonialism flourished alongside mercantilism, but the nations seeding the world with settlements weren't trying to increase trade\", ' Most colonies were set up with an economic system that smacked of feudalism, with their raw goods going back to the motherland and, in the case of the British colonies in North America, being forced to repurchase the finished product with a pseudo-currency that prevented them from trading with other nations', '', 'It was economist Adam Smith who noticed that mercantilism was a regressive system that was creating trade imbalances between nations and keeping them from advancing', ' His ideas for a free market opened the world to capitalism', \"Adam Smith's ideas were well-timed, as the Industrial Revolution was starting to cause tremors that would soon shake the Western world\", ' The (often-literal) gold mine of colonialism

to be built near waterways or windmills to function, industrialists began building in the cities where there were now thousands of people to supply labor', '', 'Capitalism involved reorganizing society into social classes based not on ownership of land, but ownership of capital (in other words, businesses)', ' Capitalists were able to earn profits from the surplus labor of the working class,

socialist economy, the state owns and manages the vital means of production', ' However, other differences also exist in the form of equity, efficiency, and employment', '', 'The capitalist economy is unconcerned about equitable arrangements', ' The primary concern of the socialist model is the redistribution of wealth and resources from the rich to the poor, out of fairness, and to ensure equality in opportunity and equality of outcome', ' Equality is valued above high achievement, and the collective good is viewed above the opportunity for individuals to advance', '', 'The capitalist argument is that the profit incentive drives corporations to develop innovative new products desired by the consumer and in demand in the marketplace', ' It is argued that the state ownership of the means of production leads to inefficiency because, without the motivation to earn more money, management, workers, and developers are less likely to put forth the extra effort to push new ideas or products',

Marx argued that, over time, capitalist businesses would drive one another out of business through fierce competition, while, at the same time, the laboring class would swell and begin to resent their unfair conditions', ' His solution was socialism, through which the means of production would be handed over to the laboring class in an egalitarian fashion', 'Today, many countries operate with capitalist production, but this also exists along a spectrum', ' In reality, there are elements of pure capitalism that operate alongside otherwise-socialist institutions', '', 'The standard spectrum of economic systems places laissez-faire capitalism at one extreme and a complete planned economy—such as communism—at the other', ' Everything in between could be said to be a mixed economy', ' The mixed economy has elements of both central planning and unplanned private business', ' By this definition, nearly every country in the world has a mixed economy', 'When the government owns some but not all the means of production and may legally circumvent, replace, limit, or otherwise regulate private economic interests, it is said to be a mixed economy or mixed economic system', ' A mixed economy respects property rights, but places limits on them', '', 'Property owners are restricted as to how they exchange with one another', ' These restrictions come in many forms, such as minimum wage laws, tariffs, quotas, windfall taxes, license restrictions, prohibited products or contracts, direct public expropriation, antitrust legislation, legal tender laws, subsidies, and eminent

laissez-faire capitalism or anarcho-capitalism, all industries are left up to private ownership and operation, including public goods, and no central government authority provides regulation or supervision of economic activity in general', 'An example of capitalist production would be if an entrepreneur starts a new widget company and opens a factory', ' This individual uses available capital that they own or from outside investors and buys the land, builds the factory, orders the machinery, and sources the raw materials', ' Workers are then hired by the entrepreneur to operate the machines and produce widgets', \" Note that the workers don't own the machines they use or the widgets that they produce\", ' Instead, they receive only wages in exchange for their labor', ' These

of capital', ' While capitalism has been praised for improving the standard of living for many people across the board, it has by far benefited those at the top', '', 'Because of how it is structured, capitalism will always pit business owners and investors against the working class', ' Capitalists are also in competition against one another, and so will seek to increase their profits by cutting

conflict', '', 'Is Capitalism the Same as Free Enterprise?', 'Capitalism and free enterprise are often seen as synonymous', ' In truth, they are closely related yet distinct terms with overlapping features', ' It is possible to have a capitalist economy without complete free enterprise, and a free market without capitalism', ' Any economy is capitalist as long as private individuals control the

be understood to mean economic exchanges free of coercive government influence', '', 'Capitalism is an economic and political system where trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit', ' Its core principles are accumulation, ownership, and profiting from capital', ' In its purest form, capitalism works best when these private owners have assurances that the wealth they

Meanwhile, people’s rights are in jeopardy worldwide from threats old and new. At the same time, the year ahead provides meaningful opportunities for progress, whether at the ballot box or within our multilateral system.\n",
            "As we look ahead, we spoke with leaders across the UN Foundation about the five issues they think will shape our world the most in 2024.\n",
            "1. CRISES ARE CONVERGING EVERYWHERE AND ALL AT ONCE\n",
            "The world is deeply interconnected, and increasingly, so, too, are the crises and risks we face. To effectively tackle our shared challenges and accelerate global progress, we need to reject old siloed ways of doing things, embrace new ways of thinking, and push for systemic change. Too much is at stake if the world doesn’t come together to leverage our collective capacities for greater impact and progress.\n",
            "David Steven, Senior Fellow: This is definitely an age of global crisis. It often feels like the end of a game of Tetris, when the blocks start falling so quickly that you can’t see what’s coming next and there’s a feeling that you can’t keep up.\n",
            "Julie Kofoed, Senior Director, Sustainable Development Initiatives: The complex, converging crises pummeling our world only reinforce the need for systems change. I was excited to see those conversations emerge after the latest Global Sustainable Development Report. The central idea is that we need to work through strategic entry points in order to have impact across all of the Sustainable Development Goals. So it’s a move away from the emphasis we often see on individual SDGs. Rather than choosing one SDG to champion, we’re supposed to engage in a transformative way across entry points to have an impact across all 17 SDGs. It’s the primary message I want to see pushed across the UN system in 2024.\n",
            "Caroline Kleinfox, Director, U.S. SDG Policy Planning: The SDGs are a powerful tool to help us break down existing data silos and structural silos across issues. By design, the framework gives us a way to confront our challenges in a coordinated way.\n",

            "A Nurse Practitioner explains the importance of having children vaccinated, including against rotavirus, in Samoa. Photo: UNICEF/Akshaya Mishra\n",
            "Cecilia Mundaca Shah, Senior Director, Global Health: With climate change, we can easily see how issues overlap. Take air pollution, for example, which clearly impacts our health. And as temperatures rise and extreme weather becomes more common, we’re also seeing vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue appear in countries that had either eliminated the disease or had never seen it. The climate crisis is a health crisis.\n",
            "But the problem is, our systems haven’t caught up. There’s a growing realization that the way we’ve always worked in the global health field — and probably in other disciplines as well — is too siloed. We need to be thinking differently. How can our health systems reduce emissions to help mitigate climate change? And on the adaptation side, how can we incorporate data from early warning systems — which the UN is rapidly scaling up in the next few years — into our health systems?\n",
            "Luisa Kislinger, Senior Manager, Girls and Women Strategy: I just came from a workshop in Mexico, where our colleagues from the Caribbean region shared that they secured funding for gender equality programming by tying it to climate justice. They’re doing joint programming around the two agendas because there’s more funding available for climate — and the reality is that climate and gender justice are themselves inextricably linked.\n",
            "Cecilia: Another example is antimicrobial resistance, or AMR. This is not just about prescribing antibiotics, it’s about the antibiotics we use to grow our food and raise our livestock. It’s a really complex issue that needs a whole-of-society response.\n",
            "There will be a high-level meeting on AMR in 2024, which presents an opportunity to make this a political priority — and not just for Ministers of Health — because AMR, like a pandemic, is a global risk that will collapse our societies and cause our economies to fully fail. So we need to see a strong political declaration and outcome document from that meeting that positions AMR not only as a health crisis, but also as a systemic global risk.\n",
            "2. OUR FUTURE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2024\n",
            "More people will head to the polls in 2024 than ever before: 76 countries will hold elections — whether at the national, regional, or local level — representing over half of the world’s population. Our experts will be watching to see how the world shows up and participates in this major election year, whether they will vote for change, and what the outcomes will mean for women’s rights and representation, in particular.\n",

            "But the sad reality is that even people who can participate in democracy often don’t. We’ll miss this moment and opportunity for change if we don’t figure out how to persuade, incentivize, and encourage people to vote.\n",
            "Luisa: People around the world will be watching to see what the U.S. election, in particular, means for the global gag rule. An expanded rule would have serious implications for funding health services across the globe, especially those that support women and people living with HIV and AIDS.\n",
            "M3: The future belongs to the people who show up next year where they can. And I’m really interested to see what happens in a year when so many people around the world have a chance to vote for change.\n",
            "Julie: I’m an eternal optimist, but this does feel like a monumental moment. There are just so many compounding issues right now — from conflicts to climate change — that I think people are coming out of complacency, perhaps enough to produce something quite significant.\n",
            "M3: I want to see more people who love democracy embrace the women’s movement. Franky, they go hand in hand — especially amid a growing love affair between autocrats and sexists.\n",
            "Autocrats fear women. And the women’s movement needs more allies. So if we can align the women’s movement with the movement for democracy, we can get a lot done — and we can potentially build a more peaceful world, too. As the UN Deputy Secretary-General [Amina Mohammed] said at our recent We the Peoples awards dinner, “Men like to win wars; women like to end wars.” I don’t want to paint with too broad a brush, but why don’t we finally give women their rightful spot at the table and a real shot at negotiating and building peace? Isn’t it time to take seriously the imperative to have women’s full participation in peace and security matters?

            "Our finances are broken. The way the world handles funding for what should be global priorities — from climate to global health to gender equality — is insufficient, unsustainable, and inequitable. Our experts are eager to see conversations continue in 2024 around international financial reform and will be watching closely to see if those reforms address antiquated power dynamics, while simultaneously looking for creative ways to help bridge the gap in the immediate future.\n",
            "Julie: It’s been interesting to see how the conversation around international financial reform has grown from a niche topic to a mainstream narrative in the past year. And the conversation on financial reform ties into an even larger one around the shape of our current international system — and what needs to change in order for us to actually achieve the SDGs and the future we want.\n",
            "David: I think we’re beginning to see a diffusion of leadership within the international system, with influence shifting away from older countries with stable or shrinking populations and toward young countries where the bulk of future generations will be born. With many of those countries in Africa, we should all be excited about the first G20 to be held on the continent when South Africa hosts in 2025 — especially following Brazil’s presidency in 2024.\n",
            "Pete Ogden, Vice President, Climate and Environment: International financial institution reform is definitely an issue to watch; there is simply no way to scale climate finance without it. And with new leadership at the World Bank, there is an opportunity to make substantial progress this year if countries can mobilize the necessary will. But institutional reform is not a silver bullet, and we need to be more creative about how we mobilize resources with the tools available to us now. Look at what’s happening at the International Maritime Organization.\n",
            "In what I consider a watershed moment, this past July the IMO raised its ambition and adopted a new greenhouse gas strategy with a goal of reducing emissions to net zero “by or around” 2050. This was significant because the sector already accounts for 3% of global emissions and that share will grow substantially if we don’t do something about it.\n",
            "Now, the IMO will develop the regulations necessary for achieving this goal. This will include a fuel standard, and, notably, an “emission pricing mechanism” that could be an important tool in mobilizing the finance needed to support a just and equitable transition to a clean, sustainable global shipping sector.\n",
            "These and many other finance-related questions will be debated next year against the backdrop of a COP where climate finance will be at the forefront of the agenda. With countries staring down the deadline to negotiate a new collective goal on climate finance, this could very well be the most important — and most contentious — item on the agenda at COP 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, next November.\n",
            "Cecilia: These are challenging conversations to have, but it’s so important that we have them. Funding for global health has been decreasing; there’s a feeling that global health had its time and its share of the money, which is now needed in so many other places.\n",
            "Looking ahead, both The Global Fund and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance will have to make investment cases for their next replenishment cycles. We fell short on those replenishments the last time around, so how is it going to be different this time?\n",
            "Like Pete said, we’ve also been pushed to think about how we can do more with the resources we have. For example, there was a realization that funding streams cannot be vertical. If we’re going to train a health care worker, why can’t we train that person to address several diseases instead of just one? That sounds obvious, but it hasn’t been the reality.\n",
            "Lori Sloate, Senior Director, Global Health: Definitely. There is only one health system in a country. There aren’t separate systems that deal with immunization, or HIV, or polio. This presents a real challenge for partners given how they’ve traditionally operated. I will be watching, pushing, and working with our partners in 2024 to make sure assets from polio and immunization services, like surveillance labs and networks, are part and parcel to any resilient health system — especially in the face of climate change, AMR, and preparing and responding to future health emergencies and pandemics.\n",

            "Inés Yábar, Lead Next Generation Fellow: While the concept of a “young country” is still relatively new, it’s taking hold as more attention is paid to the needs of countries with young, growing populations. By the end of this century, 80% of the global population will live across Africa and Asia. So when we think about achieving the SDGs and securing a better world, we have to be thinking about the places that will be home to the majority of future generations. Do young people in those countries have access to a quality education? Are they able to enjoy good health? Are there enough jobs? You can clearly see the imperative of the SDGs in the lives of young people living in those countries. And we cannot fail them. We can’t leave 80% of the world behind, because what kind of world would that be?\n",
            "Pete: There were some positive developments at COP 28 in terms of addressing the needs of many of the most climate-vulnerable communities. Most notably, a brand new climate fund was established that is dedicated to addressing loss and damage caused by increasingly devastating climate-related impacts. The Loss and Damage Fund garnered some $700 million in pledges, and while this may pale in comparison to the full economic and financial impacts of climate damage, it is still vitally needed. It’s essential that countries make good on their promises to deliver this funding.\n",
            "Countries also reached a new agreement on how to better operationalize the Paris Agreement’s global goal on adaptation. While this new adaptation framework does not provide the kind of clarity and direction that we had hoped, it nevertheless offers a foundation on which to build, and it brings some sorely needed political attention to the adaptation challenge.\n",
            "The Secretary-General’s initiative to ensure that the whole world has access to early warning systems by 2027 also got a boost at the COP, with some additional funding announced from Sweden, Denmark, and France. But there is still a long way to go — about half of the world lacks early warning systems — so we need to see more progress and support for this critical effort in 2024.\n",

Not only do digital platforms facilitate harassment against girls and women, they facilitate violence. We see this happen all the time with women journalists or with women who are running for political office, and it effectively leads to the suppression of their voices — just when we need to be elevating them the most.\n",
            "In 2023, the UN convened its first serious examination of all the ways technology and gender equality are linked at the 67th Commission of the Status of Women.

Being able to take more farsighted decisions and actions matters for everyone, but especially for younger countries, young people, and future generations.

If we’re always in firefighting mode, then we can never look ahead. We need to get better at preventing crises from happening in the first place. And we have a Secretary-General who singled out prevention as a top priority upon taking office, and this Summit is an opportunity for him to refocus on that prevention message.

Because the rates of loss are highest in some of the most biologically diverse regions on Earth, a perpetual battle is waged to manage destructive activities there while limiting the impact that such restrictions may have on the well-being of local communities. The relative importance of each threat differs within and among taxa. So far, incidental mortality from ecological disturbance, temporary or limited human disturbance, and persecution have caused limited reductions in the total number of species; however, these phenomena can be serious for some susceptible groups.

Likewise, another species undergoing a 50 percent decline over the same period would be classified as endangered, and one experiencing a 30 percent reduction over the same time frame would be considered vulnerable. It is important to understand, however, that a species cannot be classified by using one criterion alone; it is essential for the scientist doing the assessment to consider all five criteria to determine the status.

Scientists in conservation and protected area management agencies use data on species status in the development of conservation planning and prioritization, the identification of important sites and species for dedicated conservation action and recovery planning, and educational programs. Although the IUCN Red List and other similar species-assessment tools do not prescribe the action to be taken, the data within the list are often used to inform legislation and policy and to determine conservation priorities at regional, national, and international levels. In contrast, the listing criteria of other categorization systems (such as the United States Endangered Species Act, CITES, and CMS) are prescriptive; they often require that landowners and various governmental agencies take specific mandatory steps to protect species falling within particular categories of threat.\n",

To maintain healthy populations of both known and unknown species, assessments and reassessments are valuable tools. Such monitoring work must continue so that the most current knowledge can be applied to effective environmental monitoring and management efforts. For many threatened species, large well-protected conservation areas (biological reserves) often play major roles in curbing population declines. Such reserves are often cited by conservation biologists and other authorities as the best way to protect individual species as well as the ecosystems they inhabit. In addition, large biological reserves may harbour several undescribed and unassessed species. Despite the creation of several large reserves around the world, poaching and illegal trafficking plague many areas.

In some cases, however, even partial logging and accidental fires thin out the trees enough to change the forest structure dramatically.\n",
            "History\n",
            "Conversion of forests to land used for other purposes has a long history. Earth’s croplands, which cover about 49 million square km (18.9 million square miles), are mostly deforested land. Most present-day croplands receive enough rain and are warm enough to have once supported forests of one kind or another. Only about 1 million square km (390,000 square miles) of cropland are in areas that would have been cool boreal forests, as in Scandinavia and northern Canada. Much of the remainder was once moist subtropical or tropical forest or, in eastern North America, western Europe, and eastern China, temperate forest.\n",

            "The coastal forest of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, badly fragmented as portions were cleared for cattle grazing.(more)\n",
            "The extent to which forests have become Earth’s grazing lands is much more difficult to assess. Cattle or sheep pastures in North America or Europe are easy to identify, and they support large numbers of animals. At least 2 million square km (772,204 square miles) of such forests have been cleared for grazing lands. Less certain are the humid tropical forests and some drier tropical woodlands that have been cleared for grazing. These often support only very low numbers of domestic grazing animals, but they may still be considered grazing lands by national authorities. Almost half the world is made up of “drylands”—areas too dry to support large numbers of trees—and most are considered grazing lands. There, goats, sheep, and cattle may harm what few trees are able to grow.\n",
            "Although most of the areas cleared for crops and grazing represent permanent and continuing deforestation, deforestation can be transient. About half of eastern North America lay deforested in the 1870s, almost all of it having been deforested at least once since European colonization in the early 1600s. Since the 1870s the region’s forest cover has increased, though most of the trees are relatively young. Few places exist in eastern North America that retain stands of uncut old-growth forests.\n",

The greatest deforestation is occurring in the tropics, where a wide variety of forests exists. They range from rainforests that are hot and wet year-round to forests that are merely humid and moist, to those in which trees in varying proportions lose their leaves in the dry season, and to dry open woodlands. Because boundaries between these categories are inevitably arbitrary, estimates differ regarding how much deforestation has occurred in the tropics.\n",

(The rest lies along that country’s borders to the west and to the north.) Studies in the Amazon reveal that about 5,000 square km (1,931 square miles) are at least partially logged each year. In addition, each year fires burn an area about half as large as the areas that are cleared. Even when the forest is not entirely cleared, what remains is often a patchwork of forests and fields or, in the event of more intensive deforestation, “islands” of forest surrounded by a “sea” of deforested areas.\n",
            "The commercial palm oil industry rapidly expanded in the late 20th century and led to the deforestation of significant swaths of Indonesia and Malaysia as well as large areas in Africa. New plantations are often formed using slash-and-burn agricultural methods, and the resulting fragmentation of natural forests and loss of habitat threatens native plants and animals. Bornean and Sumatran orangutans are especially iconic species threatened by the expansion of oil palm farming in Indonesia.\n",
            "Deforested lands are being replanted in some areas. Some of this replanting is done to replenish logging areas for future exploitation, and some replanting is done as a form of ecological restoration, with the reforested areas made into protected land. Additionally, significant areas are planted as monotypic plantations for lumber or paper production. These are often plantations of eucalyptus or fast-growing pines—and almost always of species that are not native to the places where they are planted. The FAO estimates that there are approximately 1.3 million square km (500,000 square miles) of such plantations on Earth.\n",

            "Deforestation has important global consequences. Forests sequester carbon in the form of wood and other biomass as the trees grow, taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (see carbon cycle). When forests are burned, their carbon is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that has the potential to alter global climate (see greenhouse effect; global warming), and the trees are no longer present to sequester more carbon.\n",
            "In addition, most of the planet’s valuable biodiversity is within forests, particularly tropical ones. Moist tropical forests such as the Amazon have the greatest concentrations of animal and plant species of any terrestrial ecosystem; perhaps two-thirds of Earth’s species live only in these forests. As deforestation proceeds, it has the potential to cause the extinction of increasing numbers of these species.\n",
            "On a more local scale, the effects of forest clearing, selective logging, and fires interact. Selective logging increases the flammability of the forest because it converts a closed, wetter forest into a more open, drier one. This leaves the forest vulnerable to the accidental movement of fires from cleared adjacent agricultural lands and to the killing effects of natural droughts. As wildfires, logging, and droughts continue, the forest can become progressively more open until all the trees are lost. Additionally, the burning of tropical forests is generally a seasonal phenomenon and can severely impact air quality. Record-breaking levels of air pollution have occurred in Southeast Asia as the result of burning for oil palm plantations.\n",
            "In the tropics, much of the deforested land exists in the form of steep mountain hillsides. The combination of steep slopes, high rainfall, and the lack of tree roots to bind the soil can lead to disastrous landslides that destroy fields, homes, and human lives. With the significant exception of the forests destroyed for the oil palm industry, many of the humid forests that have been cleared are soon abandoned as croplands or only used for low-density grazing because the soils are extremely poor in nutrients. (To clear forests, the vegetation that contains most of the nutrients is often burned, and the nutrients literally “go up in smoke” or are washed away in the next rain.)\n",
            "Although forests may regrow after being cleared and then abandoned, this is not always the case, especially if the remaining forests are highly fragmented. Such habitat fragmentation isolates populations of plant and animal species from each other, making it difficult to reproduce without genetic bottlenecks, and the fragments may be too small to support large or territorial animals. Furthermore, deforested lands that are planted with commercially important trees lack biodiversity and do not serve as habitats for native plants and animals, many of which are endangered species.\n",

Resources that can be overharvested include plants, terrestrial animals, fish and marine invertebrates, and renewable natural elements, such as forests.

Overharvesting can disrupt the structure of the food chain, causing a trophic cascade. That phenomenon occurs when the natural order of predators and prey in an ecosystem is upended, and it can have far-reaching consequences. For example, the population of sea otters in the Aleutian Islands was nearly hunted to extinction for their pelts in the early 1900s. Then scientists realized that the sea otters had been keeping the sea urchin population in check, which allowed kelp to flourish in the area. Healthy kelp forests serve as habitat for fish and other marine organisms and absorb carbon dioxide as well, helping to stop ocean acidification and mitigate effects of global warming. In places where otter numbers declined, kelp abundance also declined because the unchecked population of sea urchins consumed more and more kelp.\n",

For example, overfishing often leaves many juvenile fish, which are more susceptible to predation than larger, adult fish, and it removes sexually mature fish, which reduces reproduction rates and hence makes the population even less likely to recover. About 20 million tropical fish and 12 million corals—many of them large and mature specimens—are harvested annually for the aquarium trade, depleting natural populations in some parts of the world. In Africa ivory poachers frequently slaughter the oldest elephants in a herd, dramatically altering the animals’ small, matriarchal family groups.\n",

Biodiversity, the presence of a variety of living things in a place, is an important predictor of the health of an ecosystem. Compared with areas that lack biodiversity, ecosystems that have a variety of species are more likely to be able to cope with pests and diseases, and diverse landscapes are more resistant to natural disasters like wildfires and floods. In addition, some sections of the Amazon basin and other terrestrial and marine hot spots are still unexplored and likely hold organisms unknown to science and medicine. For example, the tree Cinchona officinalis, used for centuries by Indigenous people in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador to suppress shivering, contains the alkaloid compound quinine, which was developed into the first chemotherapeutic antimalarial drug in the 1800s (see also Malaria through history).

Overharvesting trees can result in a drier, warmer, smaller forested area and reduce a region’s ability to store carbon.

Cod fishing had been entrenched in Newfoundland and Labrador, being the main industry in the province for centuries. About 1900, as technology advanced, more and more fishing operations adopted trawlers for bottom trawling, in which large nets are dragged over the ocean floor. In addition to catching hundreds of thousands of pounds of cod at a time, these nets captured nontarget species as bycatch and destroyed habitats. The pressure from foreign fisheries in the area also increased about this time. By 1970 the annual cod catch was being reported as three times too high to be sustainable, but mismanagement allowed heavy fishing to continue. By 1992 the cod population had crashed, and the Canadian government instituted a moratorium on cod fishing. The cod population has not recovered, and hence this fish is commercially extinct in the northwest Atlantic.\n",

            "Overharvesting can still be an issue even when populations are carefully monitored. In 2022 Alaska’s state government canceled the harvesting season for snow crab (genus Chionoecetes) in the Bering Sea for the first time in history following a major decline in snow crab populations, largely attributed to warming ocean temperatures coupled with the killing of crabs as bycatch by trawlers. The projected loss to Alaska’s fisheries was $500 million, and many crabbing operations were expected to be bankrupted.\n",
            "Controlling overharvesting frequently requires government intervention in industries and areas of concern, though NGOs and private-sector efforts—including those of individual firms with a vested interest in sustainability—have also had some success. Given that poaching is a major existential threat to numerous wild organisms worldwide, laws that prevent poaching and the indiscriminate trade in wildlife must be improved and enforced. Limiting the types of harvesting activities allowed in an area can also help reduce the impact of overharvesting—for example, banning trawling in snow crab breeding grounds or allowing hunting only during certain seasons and requiring the purchase of permits to take animals. Other solutions include the imposition of strict catch limits in fishing zones to ensure that fish populations can recover and the setting of bag limits for the hunting of terrestrial animals. The introduction of exclusive economic zones in 1976 has also helped retain resources for local communities. Efforts that monitor the status of individual species, such as the research that produces the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s endangered-species list, are critical in helping decision makers prioritize conservation work.\n",

Cyanobacteria and green algae are generally the first to colonize bare ground, followed by lichens and mosses, which require stable soil strata for growth. The filamentous cyanobacteria of genus Microcoleus, which are commonly found in soil, provide much of the cohesive quality of the crusts. Those microbes secrete sticky mucilage around their cells and filaments. When moistened, they move through the soil and leave a trail of sticky mucilaginous sheath material behind that glues soil particles in place.\n",
            "Biological soil crusts can be classified into four categories based on crust morphology: (1) flat, which occur in areas where freezing is rare and cyanobacteria dominate, (2) rugose, which occur in areas where freezing is rare and lichens or mosses dominate, (3) pinnacled, which are found in areas where freezing and frost heaving are common and cyanobacteria dominate, and (4) rolling, which prefer areas where freezing and frost heaving are common but lichens or mosses dominate.\n",
            "Biological crust organisms possess adaptive strategies that allow them to survive in extreme habitats on Earth. For example, they have low moisture requirements and can survive on small amounts of rainfall, fog, and dew as water sources. They are poikilohydric (capable of drying out and suspending respiration for an extended period of time); when wet, their metabolic functions begin almost immediately. They also can tolerate extreme temperatures in a desiccated state.\n",
            "Biological crusts carry out myriad ecological roles. They are important sources of fixed carbon in sparsely vegetated areas. Cyanobacteria and cyanolichens in the crusts convert atmospheric nitrogen into organic compounds that leak into surrounding soil, which is especially important in desert ecosystems where low soil nitrogen levels often limit plant growth. Crusts with roughened surfaces slow rainwater runoff and increase water infiltration into the soil. After sporadic rainfall, crust organisms and their mucilage absorb up to 10 times their volume in water and later release the water slowly into the soil.\n",
            "When dry, cyanobacterial filaments, mosses, and lichens are brittle and crush easily. As a result, mechanical disturbances, such as from vehicles and trampling by people or animals, pose significant threats to biological crusts. After disturbance, biological crust recovery may take 250 to 1,000 years in very dry regions; even in places that are relatively moist, recovery can take 20 years.\n",

Instead of planning economic decisions through centralized political methods, as with socialism or feudalism, economic planning under capitalism occurs via decentralized, competitive, and voluntary decisions.\n",
            "Capitalism is essentially an economic system in which the means of production—factories, tools, machines, raw materials, etc—are organized by one or more business owners, also known as capitalists. Capitalists then hire workers to operate the means of production in return for wages. Workers have no claim on the means of production or on the profits generated from their labor; these belong to the capitalists.1\n",

            "As such, private property rights are fundamental to capitalism. Most modern concepts of private property stem from John Locke's theory of homesteading, in which human beings claim ownership by mixing their labor with unclaimed resources. Once owned, the only legitimate means of transferring property are through voluntary exchange, gifts, inheritance, or the re-homesteading of abandoned property.2\n",
            "Private property promotes efficiency by giving the owner of resources an incentive to maximize the value of their property. The more valuable a resource is, the more trading power it provides the owner. In a capitalist system, the person who owns the property is entitled to any value associated with that property.\n",

            "When property isn't privately owned but rather is shared by the public, a problem known as the tragedy of the commons can emerge. With a common pool resource—which all people can use and none can limit access to—all individuals have an incentive to extract as much use-value as they can and no incentive to conserve or reinvest in the resource. Privatizing the resource is one possible solution to this problem, along with various voluntary or involuntary collective action approaches.3\n",
            "Under capitalist production, the business owners retain ownership of the goods being produced. If a worker in a shoe factory were to take home a pair of shoes that they made, it would be theft. This concept is known as the alienation of workers from their labor.\n",

In such trades, each party gains extra subjective value, or profit, from the transaction.\n",
            "The profit motive, or the desire to earn profits from business activity, is the driving force of capitalism. It creates a competitive environment in which businesses compete to be the low-cost producer of a certain good in order to gain market share. If it is more profitable to produce a different type of good, then a business is incentivized to switch.4\n",

However, by the late Middle Ages, rising urbanism, with cities as centers of industry and trade, became more and more economically important.\n",

Initially, each town had vastly different products and services that were slowly homogenized over time by demand.6\n",

            "After the homogenization of goods, trade was carried out in broader and broader circles: town to town, county to county, province to province, and, finally, nation to nation. When too many nations were offering similar goods for trade, the trade took on a competitive edge that was sharpened by strong feelings of nationalism on a continent that was constantly embroiled in wars.\n",
            "Colonialism flourished alongside mercantilism, but the nations seeding the world with settlements weren't trying to increase trade. Most colonies were set up with an economic system that smacked of feudalism, with their raw goods going back to the motherland and, in the case of the British colonies in North America, being forced to repurchase the finished product with a pseudo-currency that prevented them from trading with other nations.\n",

            "Industrial tycoons were the first people to amass wealth, often outstripping both the landed nobles and many of the money-lending/banking families. For the first time in history, common people could have hopes of becoming wealthy. The new money crowd built more factories that required more labor, while also producing more goods for people to purchase.During this period, the term \"capitalism\"—originating from the Latin word \"capitalis,\" which means \"head of cattle\"—rose to prominence. In 1850, French socialist Louis Blanc used the term to signify a system of exclusive ownership of industrial means of production by private individuals rather than shared ownership.9\n",

            "More efficient allocation of capital resources\n",
            "Competition leads to lower consumer prices\n",
            "Wages and general standards of living rise overall\n",
            "Spurs innovation and invention\n",
            "Cons\n",
            "Creates inherent class conflict between capital and labor\n",
            "Generates enormous wealth disparities and social inequalities\n",
            "Can incentivize corruption and crony capitalism in the pursuit of profit\n",
            "Produces negative effects such as pollution\n",
            "\n",
            "Pros Explained\n",
            "More efficient allocation of capital resources: Labor and means of production follow capital in this system because supply follows demand.\n",
            "Competition leads to lower consumer prices: Capitalists are in competition against one another, and so will seek to increase their profits by cutting costs, including labor and materials costs. Mass production also usually benefits consumers.\n",
            "Wages and general standards of living rise overall: Wages under capitalism increased, helped by the formation of unions. More and better goods became cheaply accessible to wide populations, raising standards of living in previously unthinkable ways.\n",
            "Spurs innovation and invention: In capitalism, inequality is the driving force that encourages innovation, which then pushes economic development.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cons Explained\n",
            "Creates inherent class conflict between capital and labor: While capitalists enjoy the potential for high profits, workers may be exploited for their labor, with wages always kept lower than the true value of the work being done.\n",
            "Generates enormous wealth disparities and social inequalities: Capitalism has created an immense gap between the wealthy and the poor, as well as social inequalities.\n",
            "Can incentivize corruption and crony capitalism in the pursuit of profit: Capitalism can provide incentives for corruption emerging from favoritism and close relationships between business people and the state.\n",
            "Produces negative effects such as pollution: Capitalism often leads to a host of negative externalities, such as air and noise pollution, and these costs paid for by society, rather than the producer of the effect.\n",
            "\n",
            "Capitalism vs. Socialism\n",
            "In terms of political economy, capitalism is often contrasted with socialism. The fundamental difference between the two is the ownership and control of the means of production.\n",
            "In a capitalist economy, property and businesses are owned and controlled by individuals. In a socialist economy, the state owns and manages the vital means of production. However, other differences also exist in the form of equity, efficiency, and employment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Equity\n",
            "The capitalist economy is unconcerned about equitable arrangements. The primary concern of the socialist model is the redistribution of wealth and resources from the rich to the poor, out of fairness, and to ensure equality in opportunity and equality of outcome. Equality is valued above high achievement, and the collective good is viewed above the opportunity for individuals to advance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Efficiency\n",
            "The capitalist argument is that the profit incentive drives corporations to develop innovative new products desired by the consumer and in demand in the marketplace. It is argued that the state ownership of the means of production leads to inefficiency because, without the motivation to earn more money, management, workers, and developers are less likely to put forth the extra effort to push new ideas or products.\n",
            "\n",
            "Employment\n",
            "In a capitalist economy, the state doesn't directly employ the workforce. This lack of government-run employment can lead to unemployment during economic recessions and depressions.\n",
            "In a socialist economy, the state is the primary employer. During times of economic hardship, the socialist state can order hiring, so there is full employment. Also, there tends to be a stronger \"safety net\" in socialist systems for workers who are injured or permanently disabled. Those who can no longer work have fewer options available to help them in capitalist societies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Karl Marx, Capitalism, and Socialism\n",
            "Philosopher Karl Marx was famously critical of the capitalist system of production because he saw it as an engine for creating social ills, massive inequalities, and self-destructive tendencies. Marx argued that, over time, capitalist businesses would drive one another out of business through fierce competition, while, at the same time, the laboring class would swell and begin to resent their unfair conditions. His solution was socialism, through which the means of production would be handed over to the laboring class in an egalitarian fashion.10\n",
            "\n",
            "Varieties of Capitalism\n",
            "Today, many countries operate with capitalist production, but this also exists along a spectrum. In reality, there are elements of pure capitalism that operate alongside otherwise-socialist institutions.\n",
            "The standard spectrum of economic systems places laissez-faire capitalism at one extreme and a complete planned economy—such as communism—at the other. Everything in between could be said to be a mixed economy. The mixed economy has elements of both central planning and unplanned private business. By this definition, nearly every country in the world has a mixed economy.1\n",
            "\n",
            "Mixed Capitalism\n",
            "When the government owns some but not all the means of production and may legally circumvent, replace, limit, or otherwise regulate private economic interests, it is said to be a mixed economy or mixed economic system. A mixed economy respects property rights, but places limits on them.\n",
            "Property owners are restricted as to how they exchange with one another. These restrictions come in many forms, such as minimum wage laws, tariffs, quotas, windfall taxes, license restrictions, prohibited products or contracts, direct public expropriation, antitrust legislation, legal tender laws, subsidies, and eminent domain. Governments in mixed economies also fully or partly own and operate certain industries, especially those considered public goods.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anarcho-Capitalism\n",
            "In contrast, with pure capitalism, also known as laissez-faire capitalism or anarcho-capitalism, all industries are left up to private ownership and operation, including public goods, and no central government authority provides regulation or supervision of economic activity in general.11\n",
            "\n",
            "What Is an Example of Capitalism?\n",
            "An example of capitalist production would be if an entrepreneur starts a new widget company and opens a factory. This individual uses available capital that they own or from outside investors and buys the land, builds the factory, orders the machinery, and sources the raw materials. Workers are then hired by the entrepreneur to operate the machines and produce widgets. Note that the workers don't own the machines they use or the widgets that they produce. Instead, they receive only wages in exchange for their labor. These wages represent a small fraction of what the entrepreneur earns from the venture.\n",
            "\n",
            "Who Benefits From Capitalism?\n",
            "Capitalism tends to benefit capitalists the most. These include business owners, investors, and other owners of capital. While capitalism has been praised for improving the standard of living for many people across the board, it has by far benefited those at the top.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why Is Capitalism Harmful?\n",
            "Because of how it is structured, capitalism will always pit business owners and investors against the working class. Capitalists are also in competition against one another, and so will seek to increase their profits by cutting costs, including labor costs. At the same time, workers seek higher wages, fairer treatment, and better working conditions. These two incentives are fundamentally at odds, which creates class conflict.\n",
            "\n",
            "Is Capitalism the Same as Free Enterprise?\n",
            "Capitalism and free enterprise are often seen as synonymous. In truth, they are closely related yet distinct terms with overlapping features. It is possible to have a capitalist economy without complete free enterprise, and a free market without capitalism. Any economy is capitalist as long as private individuals control the factors of production. However, a capitalist system can still be regulated by government laws, and the profits of capitalist endeavors can still be taxed heavily. \"Free enterprise\" can roughly be understood to mean economic exchanges free of coercive government influence.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Bottom Line\n",
            "Capitalism is an economic and political system where trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit. Its core principles are accumulation, ownership, and profiting from capital. In its purest form, capitalism works best when these private owners have assurances that the wealth they generate will be kept in their own pocket, which is often a controversial proposition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Capitalism is the dominant world economic system, although it often isn’t pure in form. In many countries, interventions from the state, a core trait of socialism, are frequent. Businesses are able to chase profit but within the boundaries set by the government. Most political theorists and nearly all economists argue that capitalism is the most efficient and productive system of exchange.\n",

            "Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \n",
            "we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \n",
            "\n",
            "Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \n",
            "\n",
            "And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \n",
            "\n",
            "Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \n",
            "\n",
            "We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \n",
            "\n",
            "Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \n",
            "\n",
            "First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \n",
            "\n",
            "We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n",
            "\n",
            "The scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n",
            "\n",
            "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",
            "\n",
            "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n",
            "\n",
            "And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n",
            "\n",
            "Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n",
            "\n",
            "If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n",
            "\n",
            "And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \n",
            "\n",
            "I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Third – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \n",
            "\n",
            "It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \n",
            "\n",
            "And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \n",
            "\n",
            "We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, continuing this costs money. \n",
            "\n",
            "I will soon send Congress a request. \n",
            "\n",
            "The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \n",
            "\n",
            "And we won’t stop. \n",
            "\n",
            "We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n",
            "\n",
            "I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n",
            "\n",
            "They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n",
            "\n",
            "Officer Mora was 27 years old. \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \n",
            "\n",
            "I’ve worked on these issues a long time. \n",
            "\n",
            "I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \n",
            "\n",
            "So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \n",
            "\n",
            "That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \n",
            "\n",
            "That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n",
            "\n",
            "I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n",
            "\n",
            "And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \n",
            "\n",
            "And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n",
            "\n",
            "Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n",
            "\n",
            "Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \n",
            "\n",
            "These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \n",
            "\n",
            "The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \n",
            "\n",
            "In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \n",
            "\n",
            "We cannot let this happen. \n",
            "\n",
            "Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n",
            "\n",
            "Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n",
            "\n",
            "And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \n",
            "\n",
            "A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n",
            "\n",
            "And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n",
            "\n",
            "We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \n",
            "\n",
            "We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \n",
            "\n",
            "Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \n",
            "\n",
            "Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \n",
            "\n",
            "It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \n",
            "\n",
            "That’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "If we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \n",
            "\n",
            "And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \n",

            "While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \n",
            "\n",
            "And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \n",
            "\n",
            "So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \n",

            "First, beat the opioid epidemic. \n",
            "\n",
            "There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \n",
            "\n",
            "If you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \n",
            "\n",
            "Second, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \n",
            "\n",
            "Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \n",
            "\n",
            "As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \n",
            "\n",
            "It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \n",
            "\n",
            "And let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \n",
            "\n",
            "Third, support our veterans. \n",
            "\n",
            "Veterans are the best of us. \n",
            "\n",

Instead of planning economic decisions through centralized political methods, as with socialism or feudalism, economic planning under capitalism occurs via decentralized, competitive, and voluntary decisions.\n",

Capitalists then hire workers to operate the means of production in return for wages. Workers have no claim on the means of production or on the profits generated from their labor; these belong to the capitalists.1\n",
